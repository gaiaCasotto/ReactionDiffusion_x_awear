CALM COMBOS
"long slow snakes"
k = 0.063
f = 0.069
raise Da --> makes snakes faster and more squiggly
lower Da --> makes snakes slower and thinner thinner until they disappear


STRESSED
"vibrating dots"
k = 0.058
f = 0.025
lower Da --> more stressed ~ 1.050 
equilibrium --> Da = 1.312

Da < 0.8 equilibrium-ish but not in longer time spans
